# Language Learning Update 1

##### 2023-03-01

Summary:

1. I'm learning Spanish
2. With mainly comprehensible input
3. Let's see where I'm at by the end of the year

As just about everybody in my life knows, since I won't shut up about it, I've been learning Spanish. This
post documents what's going on so far, mainly for myself, so that I can almost certainly look back with
regret and mortification later on, but also so that I can stop hurting my throat by giving the CI spiel to my
friends.

My language background: I'm a native English speaker who grew up in a Cantonese household. I've taken 5
years of elementary school Cantonese, 3 years of middle school Mandarin, 3 years of high school Mandarin, and 2
quarters of university Mandarin. All that to say: I function in Cantonese well enough such that my family has to
be disappointed in my career instead, and I'm practically worthless when it comes to Mandarin.

A brief timeline of my Spanish learning so far:

* A while ago: 2 months or so of Duolingo
* Fall 2021: SPAN 101 at community college
* Spring 2022: SPAN 102 at community college
* 2022-07-24: Started [Language Transfer](https://www.languagetransfer.org/)
* 2022-08-15: Started comprehensible input with Dreaming Spanish
* 2023-02-24: Finished Language Transfer, started 15 Kanji/day
  via [Remembering the Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi)
  and [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
* 2023-02-28: 179 hours of Spanish input

The spiel: for now, I'm pretty much all-in on
the [comprehensible input](https://comprehensibleinputwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page)
method. [Dreaming Spanish](https://www.dreamingspanish.com/method) basically says: get 1000+ hours of _comprehensible_
input, then read and converse a lot, and that's how you acquire a language. Grammar, output (speaking), pronunciation,
translation - those are all either unnecessary or even harmful in the early stages, and input is the best method to
natively absorb a language. For better or worse, I've learned some level of grammar Spanish due to the two semesters of
classes and Language Transfer, but I don't think it's actively hurt me yet.

My current input goal is 70 minutes/day; I'm hoping to have at least 600 hours of input by the end of the
year, which is not mathematically sound (I'd have to get 118 minutes/day to reach that goal). However, my
experience so far is that CI is absolutely a snowball: the better my comprehension, the easier it is to consume
more content, since I will increasingly be able to understand longer, more interesting media (podcasts, TV
shows, YouTube channels that interest me, video games, etc).

## Some Questions That People Don't Actually Ask Me, But I'm Insecure So I've Answered Them For Myself

> What level of Spanish can you currently understand?

[This video](https://youtu.be/ah3GH6fDq3E) is highly comprehensible for me (maybe 90-95%).

>  Why not Duolingo/other app?

Duolingo had me practice highly gamified garbage (even though I play FGO hmm) that is completely useless
in practice, it taught me nothing about the context of what I was "learning," and it _heavily_
relied on translation, which is very obviously not good. When will I ever fill in the blank or pick from
a word bank? When will there ever be exactly one right answer for what to say in a situation? When will
I have the time to translate back and forth from English in a real conversation? And how is it valuable
whatsoever to formulate sentences when I have no means of understanding what someone is saying back to
me?

> How can you possibly learn a language without speaking it?
