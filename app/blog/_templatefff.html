        Summary:
    <ol>
        <li>I'm learning Spanish</li>
        <li>With mainly comprehensible input</li>
        <li>Let's see where I'm at by the end of the year</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        As just about everybody in my life knows, since I won't shut up about it, I've been learning Spanish. This
        post documents what's going on so far, mainly for myself, so that I can almost certainly look back with
        regret and mortification later on, but also so that I can stop hurting my throat by giving the CI spiel to my
        friends.
    </p>
    <p>
        My language background: I'm a native English speaker who grew up in a Cantonese household. I've taken 5
        years of elementary school Cantonese, 3 years of middle school Mandarin, 3 years of high school Mandarin, and 2
        quarters of university Mandarin. All that to say: I function in Cantonese well enough such that my family has to
        be disappointed in my career instead, and I'm practically worthless when it comes to Mandarin.

        A brief timeline of my Spanish learning so far:
    <ul>
        <li>A while ago: 2 months or so of Duolingo</li>
        <li>Fall 2021: SPAN 101 at community college</li>
        <li>Spring 2022: SPAN 102 at community college</li>
        <li>2022-07-24: Started <a href="https://www.languagetransfer.org/">Language Transfer podcast</a></li>
        <li>2022-08-15: Started comprehensible input with Dreaming Spanish</li>
        <li>2023-02-24: Finished Language Transfer, started 15 Kanji/day via <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi">Remembering the
            kanji</a> and <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a></li>
        <li>2023-02-28: 179 hours of Spanish input</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The spiel: for now, I'm pretty much all-in on the <a
            href="https://comprehensibleinputwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page">comprehensible input</a> method. <a
            href="https://www.dreamingspanish.com/method">Dreaming Spanish</a> basically says: get 1000+ hours of
        <i>comprehensible</i>
        input, then read and converse a lot, and that's how you acquire a language. Grammar, output (speaking),
        pronunciation, translation - those are all either unnecessary or even harmful in the early stages, and input
        is the best method to natively absorb a language. For better or worse, I've learned some level of grammar
        Spanish due to the two semesters of classes and Language Transfer, but I don't think it's actively hurt me
        yet.

    <p>
        My current input goal is 70 minutes/day; I'm hoping to have at least 600 hours of input by the end of the
        year, which is not mathematically sound (I'd have to get 118 minutes/day to reach that goal). However, my
        experience so far is that CI is absolutely a snowball: the better my comprehension, the easier it is to consume
        more content, since I will increasingly be able to understand longer, more interesting media (podcasts, TV
        shows, YouTube channels that interest me, video games, etc).

        <h2>Some Questions That People Don't Actually Ask Me, But I'm Insecure So I've Answered Them For Myself</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div>
            <blockquote>> What level of Spanish can you currently understand?</blockquote>
            <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ah3GH6fDq3E">This video</a> is highly comprehensible for me (maybe 90-95%).</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <blockquote>> Why not Duolingo/other app?</blockquote>
            <p>Duolingo had me practice highly gamified garbage (even though I play FGO hmm) that is completely useless
                in practice, it taught me nothing about the context of what I was "learning," and it <em>heavily</em>
                relied on translation, which is very obviously not good. When will I ever fill in the blank or pick from
                a word bank? When will there ever be exactly one right answer for what to say in a situation? When will
                I have the time to translate back and forth from English in a real conversation? And how is it valuable
                whatsoever to formulate sentences when I have no means of understanding what someone is saying back to
                me?</p>
