# Language Learning Update 3

##### 2024-12-31

Welcome back! I'm coming in tepidly on the last day of 2024 with this year's language learning update.

###### I hate driving, but getting more input is its only redeeming trait

## Summary

* I'm still focused on acquiring Spanish and Japanese through comprehensible input (CI)
    * Reminder: this means listening to the target language in contexts that I can (mostly) understand
* My focus has shifted largely to consuming Japanese input, with about a 3:1 split between it and Spanish
* I've started reading Japanese and speaking Spanish a bit, both rewarding and fun ways to interact with the languages
  more
* CI has been working, it is actively working, and I have every reason to believe it will continue to work

## Spanish

I continue to track hours through [Dreaming Spanish](https://dreamingspanish.com) (DS), hence broad numbers only:

* 2023-12-23: 479 hours
* 2024-12-31: 644 hours
* Difference: 165 hours over 373 days
* Current daily goal: 20 minutes/day
* Actual rate: 26 minutes/day

As you can see, because of the aforementioned shift in prioritization, I substantially dropped my Spanish input
this year compared to 2023, and it's probably going to stay at this rate for the foreseeable future.

### Input

Higher comprehension means an easier time finding sources of input. I was able to watch dubbed anime (largely Black
Clover) to carry me through to 600 hours, and then I've just been listening to an episode of No Hay Tos every day.

* 479 ‚Äî 600: How To Spanish (podcast), Kaguya-sama: Love Is War, Classroom of the Elite, Reborn as a Vending Machine,
  Black Clover
* 600+: No Hay Tos (podcast)

Reading-wise, I... legit didn't read anything this year.

### Output

üö®üö® BETRAYAL OF CI PURISM ALERT üö®üö®

üö®üö® SUSPECT IS ARMED WITH 600 HOURS OF INPUT AND IS DANGEROUSLY MAKING IMPERFECT SUBJUNCTIVE MISTAKES üö®üö®

üö®üö® ENGAGE AT YOUR OWN RISK üö®üö®

I started speaking with an iTalki tutor in November. My Spanish is halting, awkward, and filled with grammatical errors,
but I do feel I can communicate basic ideas. When I try to express complex thoughts, I stumble because I want to use
words that I simply haven't acquired yet, which is natural and not really concerning. Apparently, my pronunciation and
articulation are quite clear; I immediately _know_ when I spit out a word that's incorrectly pronounced, as it just
sounds wrong. I chalk that up to the input working its magic (or it's just a clever flattery play that my tutor does
with everyone).

Why did I choose to begin outputting? It pains me to say, but... no reason in particular? I just felt like speaking
and interacting more with the world around me in Spanish.

### Final thoughts on Spanish

Despite my lower input, I feel really comfortable and at home with Spanish. Lately, I've been able to consume podcasts
while doing some mindless drum practice, which is wild because I have both the metronome and the podcast going
simultaneously. I can talk to people if needed, and I'm happy to plod along on my acquisition journey at a steady pace.

## Japanese

My goal was to reach 600 hours this year, which did not happen. However, the amazing thing about a CI approach
is that I'm strangely at peace with missing these big number goals. Internally, I know that as long as I keep receiving
input, I will eventually acquire more and more of the language.

* 2023-12-23: 108 hours
* 2024-12-31: 478 hours
* Difference: 370 hours over 373 days
* Current daily goal: 60 minutes/day
* Average rate: 59.5 minutes/day (so close to 60!)

### Input

![breakdown by resource](https://i.imgur.com/PFqQe8B.png)

Beyond the occasional [CIJ](https://cijapanese.com/) video, I primarily cycled through a number of podcasts this year:

* Nihongo con Teppei Beginners (2x through!)
* Bite Size Japanese Podcast (2x through!)
* Japanese with Shun / Oyasumi Japanese with Shun
* Sakura Tips
* Nihongo Storytime Beginners

I remain quite miffed at all the podcasts out there claiming to be "beginner" podcasts when they're actually not.
IMO _vocabulary_ is the most fundamental thing to level-match ‚Äî it doesn't matter how slowly you're speaking if I only
know 50% of the words you're using. But if I know 90% of the words you're using, then speaking quickly isn't a problem
at all.

Once again, shoutout to Nami for continuing [crosstalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMhzHnP5Q-Q) with me for this
entire year. I really look forward to our biweekly chats, and I just can't recommend crosstalk enough as the most
enjoyable way to get input. If you're learning a language, and you have a native-speaking friend, definitely give it a
shot.

### Kanji

Last year's revving of Anki worked out, and I finished all new cards in the RTK deck by ome
lly. I just spend a quick 5-10
minutes on reviews every day.

My favorite kanji remains ËÉû (placenta). Congratulations.

### Kana

I learned both hiragana and katakana this year through a combination
of [http://www.japanese-lesson.com](http://www.japanese-lesson.com), [https://www.readthekanji.com/](https://www.readthekanji.com/),
and Anki. If I were to do it again, I'd simply start with Anki ‚Äî the other tools weren't better in any differentiating
way.

### Reading

I started reading one small book a day using [Free Tadoku Books](https://tadoku.org/japanese/en/free-books-en), a
remarkable free resource. Initially, my motivation was just to be able to go to Japan and read basic signage, but it's
been much more fascinating than I expected. I struggle as I sound out each kana, but once I hear the words out
loud, I know what they mean due to all my input. Only rarely do I encounter words that I don't know, and usually they're
less common nouns (e.g. names of foods, plants, and animals).

It's equally interesting with kanji. I know what each kanji means approximately due to RTK, and I know the meaning of
the words when pronounced out loud due to input, so my brain only needs to make the connection between the two.
For example, with Á•ûÁ§æ, the process looked something like:

1. Decipher the individual kanji meanings as "gods" and "company". Not sure exactly what that means...
2. Read the furigana out loud: „Åò„Çì„Åò„ÇÉ
3. From the pronunciation, I know what it means (Shinto shrine), and that makes decent sense with "gods" and "company"
4. Connection established ü§ù

Reading has also helped my brain formalize words that I hear all the time but never consciously have to think about,
often small adverbs or particles. Grammar study isn't on my roadmap yet, but I wonder how far my understanding can get
with just reading a bit.

### Output

I have to admit something even more appalling, even graver, beyonder the pale: I tried speaking Japanese a bit too. In
preparation for my upcoming trip to Japan, I figured that I might try my hand and see what hundreds of hours of pure
input would get me in terms of speaking, but the answer is truly: not much. I gave up after one session ‚Äî it was
frustrating and bad and I'm not surprised at all. I knew the words existed, but I couldn't magically pull them
out of my head.

Will input magically make you conversational? Clearly not _this_ amount of input. That's what this whole long-term
experiment is about, right, that enough input will eventually enable output? It's obvious that the amount I have now is
not enough yet. If my Japanese comprehension isn't at parity with my Spanish comprehension, then it stands to reason
that my speaking wouldn't match either. And hence...

### Final thoughts on Japanese

Japanese is hard! It's way harder than Spanish! At 476 hours of Spanish, I was able to watch dubbed TV with some
difficulty, but I'm nowhere near that with Japanese. Despite my lofty ambitions, this year really only reinforced that
language acquisition is slow and gradual. I can't simply uproot my life to consume 6 hours of input a day, but as long
as I keep listening to Japanese, I'm confident that I'll improve.

## End

This is really a "more of the same" update. Thanks again for giving it a read, and if you're interested at all in
acquiring a language through input, go for it! You only need to start with 10 minutes a day.
