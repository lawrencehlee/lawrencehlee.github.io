    <h1>Language Learning Update 1</h1>
<h5>2023-03-01</h5>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm learning Spanish</li>
<li>With mainly comprehensible input</li>
<li>Let's see where I'm at by the end of the year</li>
</ol>
<p>As just about everybody in my life knows, since I won't shut up about it, I've been learning Spanish. This
post documents what's going on so far, mainly for myself, so that I can almost certainly look back with
regret and mortification later on, but also so that I can stop hurting my throat by giving the CI spiel to my
friends.</p>
<p>My language background: I'm a native English speaker who grew up in a Cantonese household. I've taken 5
years of elementary school Cantonese, 3 years of middle school Mandarin, 3 years of high school Mandarin, and 2
quarters of university Mandarin. All that to say: I function in Cantonese well enough such that my family has to
be disappointed in my career instead, and I'm practically worthless when it comes to Mandarin.</p>
<p>A brief timeline of my Spanish learning so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>A while ago: 2 months or so of Duolingo</li>
<li>Fall 2021: SPAN 101 at community college<ul>
<li>Spring 2022: SPAN 102 at community college</li>
<li>2022-07-24: Started <a href="https://www.languagetransfer.org/">Language Transfer</a></li>
<li>2022-08-15: Started comprehensible input with Dreaming Spanish</li>
<li>2023-02-24: Finished Language Transfer, started 15 Kanji/day
  via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi">Remembering the Kanji</a>
  and <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a></li>
<li>2023-02-28: 179 hours of Spanish input</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The spiel: for now, I'm pretty much all-in on
the <a href="https://comprehensibleinputwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page">comprehensible input</a>
method. <a href="https://www.dreamingspanish.com/method">Dreaming Spanish</a> basically says: get 1000+ hours of <em>comprehensible</em>
input, then read and converse a lot, and that's how you acquire a language. Grammar, output (speaking), pronunciation,
translation - those are all either unnecessary or even harmful in the early stages, and input is the best method to
natively absorb a language. For better or worse, I've learned some level of grammar Spanish due to the two semesters of
classes and Language Transfer, but I don't think it's actively hurt me yet.</p>
